Banker Lab (Lab 3) for Operating Systems Spring 2016

I used Java for this Lab.

4 files are part of this submission:
	-> Main.java
	-> Task.java
	-> Activity.java
	-> OptimisticManager.java
	-> Banker.java

To compile the lab, execute
$ javac Main.java

To run the lab, execute
$ java Main <inputFileName>

there inputFileName is a command line argument text file

The code was compiled and tested on mauler.cims.nyu.edu.
